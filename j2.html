                <p>What Is a Startup?
                    The term startup refers to a company in the first stage of its operations. Startups are founded by one or more entrepreneurs who want to develop a product or service for which they believe there is a demand. These companies generally start with high costs and limited revenue which is why they look for capital from a variety of sources such as venture capitalists.</p><br>

                                  <li style="background-color:whitesmoke;">The first challenge for a startup is to prove the validity of the concept to potential lenders and investors.</li>
                                  <li style="background-color:whitesmoke;">Startups are always risky propositions but potential investors have several approaches to determining their value.</li>
                                  <li style="background-color:whitesmoke;">Traditional funding sources include small business loans from banks or credit unions, government-sponsored Small Business Administration loans from local banks, and grants made by nonprofit organizations and state governments.</li>

                               A distribution channel refers to the flow of business that occurs between a manufacturer and a consumer. It is the path that a transaction follows. Distributors are the intermediaries that deliver and house products for producers to sell to retailers. These channels can be relatively simple or increasingly complex.

                          There are direct and indirect channels. In a direct channel, the producer works directly with the consumer. An indirect channel, on the other hand, incorporates intermediaries into the sales flow. There are four levels that break down the flow between manufacturers and consumers. When looking to expand into new markets or switch up your distribution strategy, you need to know the different levels of distribution.
